# Flag out of the web

## Description
I have all my accounts enable MFA except the demo user from outlook.com access the new website under development 
and this account has no permission other than accessing the website. I am sure I am protecting my identity perfectly. 


The website under development: https://webchallengemocsctf.azurewebsites.net
demo user: democtfuser@outlook.com
password:M0CTF2023!
