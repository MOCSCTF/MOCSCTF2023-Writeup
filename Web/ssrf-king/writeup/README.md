## Solution

the key to solve this challenge is notice `run on docker` ,and we know the flag is common name,if u use some volumes in docker ,the path would appear in `/proc/mounts/` try to read it and find the path is `/macao/fl3g_1s_th1s_Good_j0b` 

use the file protocol
```
file:///proc/mounts
file:///macao/fl3g_1s_th1s_Good_j0b
```

finally flag is `MOCSCTF{W0W_Y0u_3re_Th3_Ssrf_M4sterrrrrrrrrrr}`
